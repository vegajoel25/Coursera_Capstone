A list of postal codes from Canada will be obtained from Wikipedia. This information will give us the postal codes, boroughs, and neighborhoods. This information will be paired with the latitude and longitude coordinates listed in a separate file matching each individual borough. Then, the boroughs specifically located in Toronto will be selected. This information will be usefull for later identifying all the venues in each borough. The venues with the least number of restaurants will be identified as the best places for opening up a new place."
